# MetWork/mfcom cheatsheet



## `root` service commands

As `root` unix user:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `service metwork start` | start all installed metwork services |
| `service metwork stop` | stop all installed metwork services |
| `service metwork status` | check all installed metwork services |
| `service metwork start mfcom` | start mfcom metwork services |
| `service metwork stop mfcom` | stop mfcom metwork services |
| `service metwork status mfcom` | check mfcom metwork services |

> Note: if you don't have `service` command on your Linux distribution, you can use `/etc/rc.d/init.d/metwork` instead of `service metwork`. For example: `/etc/rc.d/init.d/metwork start` instead of `service metwork start`. If your Linux distribution uses `systemd`component, you can also start metwork services with classic `systemctl` commands.



## root files or directories

| Path | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/etc/metwork.config.d/mfcom/config.ini` | override the `mfcom` module configuration at system level (note: the first line of this file must be `[INCLUDE_config.ini]`) |
| `/opt/metwork-mfcom/config/config.ini` | default `mfcom` module configuration (**do not edit this file** => use the overriding previous file) |


## "load environment" commands

As a "not metwork" unix user:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `source /opt/metwork-mfcom/share/interactive_profile` | FIXME |
| `source /opt/metwork-mfcom/share/profile` | FIXME |
| `/opt/metwork-mfcom/bin/mfcom_wrapper {YOUR_COMMAND}`| FIXME |
| `outside {YOUR_COMMAND}`| FIXME |

> Note: if you don't have `/opt/metwork-mfcom` symbolic link, use `/opt/metwork-mfcom-{BRANCH}` instead.
